This file is base on the README file from ARGoS examples written 
by Carlo Pinciroli found here:

*** INTRODUCTION ***

In this package you'll find the project files to the Collective Learning 
in Swarm Robotics.

To run an experiment with ARGoS, you need two things:
1. the robot controllers
2. the experiment configuration


*** COMPILATION ***

In principle, you can compile your code however you want. In practice,
the help of a build system makes your work much easier. In ARGoS, and
in these examples, we use CMake. To compile the examples, open up a
shell, go to the directory where you unpacked the tar.bz2 file and
type:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build

To produce debuggable code (slow), type:

$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..

To produce fast but not debuggable code, type:

$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..

Finally, launch the compilation with the command:

$ make

If you find no error, you're ready to go to the next phase.


***THE SETUPS***

SINGLE FEATURE OBJECT MANIPLATION 

You need the following files to run the project

1. area_clearning.argos found in experiments
2. footbot_areacleaning.cpp and footbot_areacleaning.h
   found in controllers/footbot_areacleaning
3. The area_cleaning loop and qt functions found in 
   loop_functions/area_cleaning_loop_functions



MULTIPLE FEATURE OBJECT MANIPLATION 

You need the following files to run the project

1. feature_selection.argos found in experiments
2. footbot_featureselection.cpp and featureselection.h
   found in controllers/footbot_featureselection
3. The feature_selection loop and qt functions found in 
   loop_functions/feature_selection_loop_functions



*** RUNNING THE EXAMPLES ***

To run a setup, the configuration files have been written with the
hypothesis that you run them in the directory where you unpacked the
tar.bz2, NOT in the build/ directory. Therefore, go to that directory
and type:

$ argos3 -c experiments/area_cleaning.argos

For the single feature object manipulation setup

$ argos3 -c experiments/feature_selection.argos

For the multiple feature object manipulation setup
